Hi! My name is Evaristo Rojas.
I lead the [Data Science](https://islas.dev) [team](https://github.com/orgs/IslasGECI/people) at [ConservaciÃ³n de Islas](https://islas.org.mx).
I'm a mathematician with a background in oceanography and programming.
I like running, snorkeling, and building toys for my children.
I live in Ensenada ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ with my [wife](http://mactavishediting.com/), children, and cat.
