Hi! 👋

My name is Evaristo Rojas. I lead the [Data Science](https://islasgeci.github.io)
[team](https://github.com/orgs/IslasGECI/people) at [Conservación de Islas](https://islas.org.mx).
I'm a mathematician with a background in oceanography, and I like running, programming, and building
toys for my children. I live in Ensenada, Mexico, with my [wife](http://mactavishediting.com/),
children, and cat.
