Hello!
My name is Evaristo Rojas, and I lead the [Data Science](https://islas.dev)
[team](https://github.com/orgs/IslasGECI/people) at [ConservaciÃ³n de Islas](https://islas.org.mx).
My background is in mathematics, oceanography, and programming.
I like running, splashing on the waves, and building toys for my children.
I live in Ensenada ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ with my [wife](http://mactavishediting.com/), children, and cats.
